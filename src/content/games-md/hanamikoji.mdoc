## Card selection and drawing

To play Hanamikoji, you need 36 cards and a minimum of 8 drawings, up to 15 if you want to play with only cards.

### Instructions

![cards mapping](/images/mappings/hanamikoji.png)

{% usedCards layout="basic" cards=[
   50, 51, 52,
   0, 1, 2,
   20, 21, 22,
   10, 11, 12, 13,
   40, 41, 42, 43,
   30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
   80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85,
   60, 61, 62, 63,
   70, 71, 72, 73,
] /%}

## Usage

The Victory markers are merged into the Geisha cards. To use them, rotate the Geisha card pointing to the winning player (up or down). In case of a tie, point to wherever there are no players (left or right).

If you have 7 small objects, like coins, you can avoid drawing the Victory markers' arrows, and use the tokens like in the normal game instead of rotating the card.

If you want to make the game easier to play, write the amount of item cards of its own suit in the drawing area C.

  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
  21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
  31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
  41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46,
  51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56,
  61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66,

  111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116,
  "back"] /%}

If you play with 4 or more teams, instead of grouping cards by suit, [group them by rank](/manual#8-suits-of-15-ranks), this way you can have up to 15 different types of crabs.

## Usage

- A set of cards are the cards with the same number

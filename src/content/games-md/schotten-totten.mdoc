1. Select 6 suits.
1. Pick the ranks 1 to 9 from every chosen suit.
1. Select 10 cards from any other suit.
   {% callout type="idea" %}
   Choose a black suit, so it's easy to tell the two kinds of cards apart. Alternatively, choose 0s of any suit.
   {% /callout %}
1. Draw the Tactic cards icons in the drawing area B of those 10 cards. Remember that there are 2 jokers.
   {% callout type="idea" %}
   You can draw in only one corner to save up space, but it will be inconvenient while playing.
   {% /callout %}
1. Use any 9 unused card backs as Stone tiles.
   {% callout type="idea" %}
   You can use tokens as Stone tiles instead.

## Card selection and drawing

To play Mafia de Cuba, you need 23-25 cards and 8-10 drawings (2 optional cards).

{% callout type="idea" text="You can use more generic role names, so you can re-use the cards. For example, rename \"Loyal\" to \"Good\"" /%}

Instead of passing the bag, you'll be passing the deck of cards.

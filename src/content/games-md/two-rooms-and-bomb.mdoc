## Card selection and drawing

To play Two Rooms and a Boom, you need 1 drawing per card, and as many cards as you'll use.

### Instructions

![cards mapping](/images/mappings/two-rooms-and-bomb.png)

{% callout type="idea" %}
You don't need to write all characters in advance, just draw the ones you plan to use.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="idea" %}
If you run out of cards of the same color use: {% suit id="0" /%} = {% suit id="8" /%}, {% suit id="1" /%} = {% suit id="9" /%}, {% suit id="7" /%} = {% suit id="6" /%}.
{% /callout %}

### Usage

If you need to color share, you can't use the card itself (because the rank can expose your role). You have 2 options:

1. The players whisper it, and agree to never lie when color sharing.
1. At the beginning, each player privately picks a token matching their color, and shows it when color sharing.
